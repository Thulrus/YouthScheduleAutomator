# AI-Generated Documentation

This directory contains AI-generated summary documents, technical analyses, and historical records of major project changes.

## Contents

- **DETERMINISM.md** - Technical deep-dive on the scheduler's deterministic behavior and state continuity
- **DETERMINISM_EXAMPLE.md** - Practical examples and usage patterns for deterministic scheduling
- **MIGRATION.md** - Migration guide from previous versions
- **CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md** - Summary of code cleanup and refactoring
- **RESTRUCTURE_SUMMARY.md** - Documentation of project restructuring
- **TASKS_COMPLETE.md** - Historical record of completed tasks

## Purpose

These documents are kept separate from user-facing documentation to:

1. Maintain a clean root directory
2. Preserve historical context and decision-making
3. Provide technical reference for future development
4. Document the evolution of the project

## User-Facing Documentation

For end-user documentation, see the root directory:

- `/README.md` - Main project documentation
- `/QUICKSTART.md` - Getting started guide
- `/CONFIG_FORMAT.md` - Configuration file format
- `/CONTRIBUTING.md` - Contribution guidelines
- `/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` - Community standards

## Contributing

When generating new AI summaries or technical documentation, please place them in this directory to keep the project organized.
