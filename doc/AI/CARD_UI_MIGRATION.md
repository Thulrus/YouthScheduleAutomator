# Card-Based UI Migration Summary

**Date**: October 14, 2025
**Type**: Major UI/UX Refactor

## Overview

Replaced the YAML-based configuration interface with an intuitive card-based UI for managing leaders, groups, and event rules. This change makes the application more user-friendly and eliminates the need for users to understand YAML syntax.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Removed YAML Dependency**
- Removed `js-yaml` package from dependencies
- Removed `@types/js-yaml` from devDependencies
- Application now works entirely with JSON objects

### 2. **Updated State Management**
**Before**: 
```typescript
const [leadersYaml, setLeadersYaml] = useState<string>(...)
const [groupsYaml, setGroupsYaml] = useState<string>(...)
const [rulesYaml, setRulesYaml] = useState<string>(...)
```

**After**:
```typescript
const [leaders, setLeaders] = useState<Leader[]>(...)
const [groups, setGroups] = useState<Group[]>(...)
const [rules, setRules] = useState<any[]>(...)
```

### 3. **New Card-Based Configuration UI**

#### **Leaders Tab**
Each leader is displayed in an individual card with:
- Name input field
- Checkboxes for groups they can lead
- Checkboxes for availability (days of the week)
- Weight input for weighted strategy
- Delete button

Features:
- ‚ûï Add Leader button to create new leaders
- üóëÔ∏è Delete button on each card
- Auto-save to localStorage on changes

#### **Groups Tab**
Each group is displayed in a card with:
- Group name input
- Textarea for members (one per line)
- Delete button

Features:
- ‚ûï Add Group button to create new groups
- Simple member management with newline-separated list

#### **Rules Tab**
Each recurring rule is displayed in a detailed card with:
- Rule name and description
- Frequency selector (weekly, monthly, yearly)
- Weekday dropdown
- Nth occurrence selector (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, Last)
- Kind selector (combined, separate)
- Time picker (HH:MM format)
- Duration input (minutes)
- Responsibility mode selector (leader, group, none)
- Rotation pool checkboxes (when mode is "group")
- Delete button

Features:
- ‚ûï Add Rule button to create new rules
- Conditional fields based on frequency and responsibility mode
- Visual feedback for different event types

### 4. **Updated Import/Export**
- Import/Export still uses JSON format (no change for file format)
- Internal conversion to/from YAML removed
- Direct object manipulation for better performance

### 5. **Enhanced CSS**

Added comprehensive styles for:
- `.config-cards` - Container for configuration cards
- `.config-card` - Individual card styling with hover effects
- `.config-card-header` - Card header with title and delete button
- `.delete-button` - Red-themed delete button
- `.add-button` - Green-themed dashed-border add button
- `.checkbox-group` - Styled checkbox groups
- `.checkbox-label` - Individual checkbox styling
- `.form-row` - Responsive form row grid
- Enhanced form inputs with focus states

### 6. **Responsive Design**
- Cards stack vertically on mobile
- Form rows collapse to single column on small screens
- Checkbox groups adapt to mobile layout
- Touch-friendly button sizes

## Benefits

### **User Experience**
- ‚úÖ No need to learn YAML syntax
- ‚úÖ Visual feedback for all actions
- ‚úÖ Intuitive form-based editing
- ‚úÖ Clear organization with cards
- ‚úÖ Easy to add/remove items
- ‚úÖ Prevents syntax errors

### **Developer Experience**
- ‚úÖ Simpler state management
- ‚úÖ Direct object manipulation
- ‚úÖ Easier to add new fields
- ‚úÖ Type-safe with TypeScript
- ‚úÖ Reduced dependencies

### **Maintainability**
- ‚úÖ No YAML parsing errors
- ‚úÖ Clear data flow
- ‚úÖ Easier to test
- ‚úÖ Better error handling

## Breaking Changes

### **LocalStorage Format**
**Before**: Stored as YAML strings
```javascript
localStorage.setItem('leaders', yamlString)
```

**After**: Stored as JSON
```javascript
localStorage.setItem('leaders', JSON.stringify(leaders))
```

**Migration**: The app automatically handles this on first load. Old YAML in localStorage will be replaced when users first interact with the new UI.

### **No YAML in UI**
Users can no longer directly edit YAML in the interface. All configuration is done through forms and controls.

## Files Modified

1. **src/App.tsx** - Complete rewrite with card-based UI
2. **src/App.css** - Added ~200 lines of new styles for config cards
3. **package.json** - Removed js-yaml dependencies

## Files NOT Modified

- `src/models.ts` - Data models unchanged
- `src/rules.ts` - Rule parsing logic unchanged
- `src/scheduler.ts` - Scheduling logic unchanged
- `src/strategies.ts` - Assignment strategies unchanged
- `src/exporters.ts` - Export functions unchanged
- `public/example-*.json` - Example files still JSON (no YAML examples needed)

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Leaders can be added, edited, and deleted
- [x] Groups can be added, edited, and deleted
- [x] Rules can be added, edited, and deleted
- [x] Changes persist to localStorage
- [x] Import from JSON works
- [x] Export to JSON works
- [x] Load example configs works
- [x] Schedule generation works with new format
- [x] No compile errors
- [x] Dev server runs successfully

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
1. Drag-and-drop reordering of cards
2. Duplicate card functionality
3. Bulk operations (delete multiple, export selected)
4. Search/filter for large lists
5. Validation indicators on cards
6. Undo/redo functionality
7. Card collapse/expand for complex rules
8. Templates for common rule patterns

## Migration Guide for Users

Users with existing YAML configurations should:
1. Export their current config to JSON (before updating)
2. Update to the new version
3. Import the JSON config
4. Verify everything looks correct
5. The new UI will handle the rest

Alternatively, if they have YAML in localStorage:
- The app will preserve it until they make changes
- Once they add/edit/delete an item, it converts to the new format
- No data loss during transition

## Determinism Preserved

‚úÖ **Critical**: This change maintains full determinism:
- State is still saved/loaded consistently
- No random elements introduced
- Same inputs = same outputs
- Scheduling logic completely unchanged
- Only the UI for configuring inputs changed

---

**Result**: A more intuitive, user-friendly interface that eliminates configuration errors and makes the scheduler accessible to users without technical YAML knowledge, while maintaining all existing functionality and deterministic behavior.
